                        <p>
                            Not much is known about Zack's past. He was admitted to the orphanage by a good samaritan when he was presumably abandoned in the streets when he was only a baby. despite all this, he grew up into an energetic and extroverted young man. He soon noticed that Eric, one of the orphans, was just sitting in a corner, talking to nobody. He was the one to approach him and befriend him, trying to get him to open up. They've become inseparable ever since. Zack became a guitarist at 16 years old and joined an Electro-Rock band called 'Starlight', and made some money by selling tickets and CDs of their songs. Zack loves exploring and thus learned how to drive and bought an old 4x4 for very cheap to satisfy that need. He would also make Eric reluctantly tag along. After they were forced to live in the city in their early adulthood, Zack and Eric attended a nearby college and thus had to live in a dorm, and Zack had to get a job as fast-food worker to make money on the side.

                        <p>
                            Despite being a Bloodhound, Eric parasite is too small and underdevelopped to have any significant effects on his psyche. He is an introvert, meaning he's very shy and not very social. Most of the time, he is calm and quiet, prefering not to be the center of attention. He doesn't have many friends due to his shyness. But every friend he makes is valuable to him and he will often share his hobbies and passions with them, and try to stay close to them. While generally non-confrontational (and a bit of a coward), he will however defend the ones he loves and cherishes and do so violently. His parasite still having a subconscious effect on him, it makes him prone to becoming excessively violent in situations like these. However nothing makes him happier than being around small fluffy animals, to the point that it makes his tail wag a lot.
