        history : `Eric Stryke is one of the last few remaining members of the much maligned Bloodhound tribe, a once unstoppable group of killer wolves who's sole purpose of existance is to kill anything that aren't part of their tribe due to a parasite embedded within each indidvidual that controls their thoughts and grows as they kill.
        #
        Eric was found when he was still very young after his mother died trying to raid a farm in the Kamosh countryside. He was brought to an orphanage not too far away where he met Zack. Being very shy and closed, he didn't make many friends. But Zack came in and helped him open up a bit.
        #
        After they were forced to move to live in the city after the orphanage got burned down by his cousin Szahag, Eric found his love of drawing and focused on that. Bloodhounds were thought extinct ever since the Great Payback more than 200 years ago following the invention of guns, so Eric is still able to live in society without people growing suspicious, especially since his Bloodhound parasite hasn't grown because he hasn't killed anyone, so it remains hidden.`,
        
        personality: `Despite being a Bloodhound, Eric's parasite is too small and underdevelopped to have any significant effects on his psyche. He is an introvert, meaning he's very shy and not very social. Most of the time, he is calm and quiet, prefering not to be the center of attention. He doesn't have many friends due to his shyness. But every friend he makes is valuable to him and he will often share his hobbies and passions with them, and try to stay close to them.
        #
        While generally non-confrontational (and a bit of a coward), he will however defend the ones he loves and cherishes and do so violently. His parasite still having a subconscious effect on him, it makes him prone to becoming excessively violent in situations like these. However nothing makes him happier than being around small fluffy animals, to the point that it makes his tail wag a lot.`

    {
        history : ` Not much is known about Zack's past. He was admitted to the orphanage by a good samaritan when he was presumably abandoned in the streets when he was only a baby. despite all this, he grew up into an energetic and extroverted young man.
        #
        He soon noticed that Eric, one of the orphans, was just sitting in a corner, talking to nobody. He was the one to approach him and befriend him, trying to get him to open up. They've become inseparable ever since. Zack became a guitarist at 16 years old and joined an Electro-Rock band called 'Starlight', and made some money by selling tickets and CDs of their songs.
        #
        Zack loves exploring and thus learned how to drive and bought an old 4x4 for very cheap to satisfy that need. He would also make Eric reluctantly tag along. After they were forced to live in the city in their early adulthood, Zack and Eric attended a nearby college and thus had to live in a dorm, and Zack had to get a job as fast-food worker to make money on the side. `,
        
        personality: `Contrary to his brother Eric, Zack is an extrovert. He's always ready to socialize and make friends. He is quite affectionate of Eric, who his caring and patient nature pushed him to help open up when Eric would just shyly sit in a corner by himself. He never leaves his side, having become a sort of parental figure for him. While his slightly girly looks may make him look frail, he can defend himself pretty well, having some knowledge of hand-to-hand combat. He is very afraid of bugs.`

        history : `Andromeda, also nicknamed “Andy”, is an artificial organic lifeform with integrated cybernetics and a screen display for a face, also known as a protogen. Part of the secret protogen research program of the megacorp Penance aerospace and biotechnologies, him and multiple other protogens were prototypes created with the purpose of one day being able to explore the stars without the constraints of a short lifespan, as well as serve as servants for the wealthy that could afford them.
        #
        Named after the Andromeda galaxy, Andy was part of the second R&D division of the program, alongside some others like Hazard, small and agile, Centurion, big and strong, and Remedy, a nurse. The researchers there were quite affectionate of their little creations and treated them well, even giving them full bedrooms instead of the mandated sleeping capsules. Andy had developed a liking for music and would often sit on his bed listening to music, to which Centurion would come in to remind him that he can’t stay in bed all day.
        #
        However the research program got cancelled around 15 years later, and ‘disposal’ of all the protogens was ordered. The research team naturally protested the liquidation of their creations and burning of a decade of hard work. So Corporate sent mercenaries to do the job for them, and made sure to warn them about that after they were already on their way. The researchers scrambled to save their creations and themselves. But before they knew it, the mercs arrived and started killing everyone there. There were casualties on both the researchers and protogen sides. Andy was in his bedroom in the meantime, when a merc broke in and was about to shoot him.  he narrowly evaded the shot and unsuccessfully tackled the merc, who was about to get him before Centurion came in and saved him, knocking the merc out. they, Remedy, Hazard, and a researcher started escaping through a back door and onto the real world. Some surviving protos and researchers followed.
        #
        Penance afterward tried to hunt down the surviving protogens but public and government backlash made them reconsider. They now act as if this event never happened, after receiving major sanctions and paying reparations to the scientists.
        #
        In the end, the protogens were accepted as part of society, and Andy pursued his love of music and became DJ.`,
        
        personality: `Andy has an easy-going and jolly personality. He likes laying down and listening to music and is often in a joyous mood. He tends to act a little childish sometimes, which can be annoying to some, but he still gets along well with his peers.
        #
        While he regrets that he may never be able to explore the stars after the Penance incident, he takes satisfaction in making others happy through sharing his love of music working as a DJ. `

        history : `Same as Eric and Zack, Meihal grew up in the orphanage. Meihal is a furred dragon, the offspring of a female dragon and a male canine. Dragons are very proud and elitist creatures, and see furred dragons as “impure” and “unholy”, looking down upon them and shunning them from their society. Meihal, being the unfortunate offspring of a female dragon and a male canine, couldn’t have had a good life due to her very nature and her kind’s views on her type, so she was dropped off at the orphanage when she was still in her egg. 
        #
        She grew up into a big and feisty girl, having developed a keen interest in mechanics from messing around with the headmaster’s car, and crafting various gadgets out of spare parts. She also got a crush on Eric after they had to help each other to clean up the orphanage library as a punishment, but she got adopted before that could go anywhere. She doesn’t seem to mind that her biological parents gave her up as an egg, considering herself lucky that she instead grew up at all with people that care about her and doesn’t shun her for what she is.
        #
        Now she lives on the outskirts of the city of Genes, where she works as a mechanic in her own workshop, fixing and tuning cars, and being a professional racer in track and rally racing.`,
        
        personality: `Meihal is a very energetic tomboy with a big heart. She can also be quite the playful type, which can lead to some mischief like the time she made a mess of the library and had to clean it up along with Eric. Her optimistic nature allowed her to grow up happy and chirpy, even despite her circumstances of birth. 
        #
        She has a strong sense of curiosity, which led her to develop her passion for cars and mechanics in general. She likes to craft various gadgets in her spare time, and got herself a job as mechanic, which she still has to this day.
        #
        Her liking for tinkering cars naturally made her fall in love with driving them, which led to her becoming a professional driver participating in track and rally racing championships.
        #
        As a teen, she had a crush on Eric, but it wasn’t able to go anywhere because she was adopted not too long after. However even after all these years, her crush for him still lingers in her heart.`

        history : `Mia's backstory isn't the most thrilling. She moved out from her parent's home to integrate the city's university and study engineering there. In order to earn some money she earned a job at Meihal's car garage as assistant, which is how they both managed to meet each other. 
        #
        Ever since she was little, she was fascinated with the way cars work by looking at her dad's car every day and wanted to learn more about them. To that end she applied to university and focus on engineering to make her dream come true and maybe even make her own cars! Her and Meihal's shared passion for cars has led them to become friends quickly.`,
        
        personality: `Contrary to Meihal, Mia is very laidback and stoic. She doesn't have much in terms of social skills and doesn't show much emotions, but she's always helpful when she's available and likes to get the job done well. She loves making snarky jokes and remarks whenever it's appropriate and she isn't one for long conversations, so she prefers small talks and tries to avoid long debates.
        #
        She has a tendency of oversleeping which can end her up in trouble during class because she's often late, but whenever she tries waking up early, she would always have to nap in the afternoon.
        #
        Despite how lazy she may seem, she's pretty hard working. Wether in university or at her work in the garage, she always tries her best doing what she loves, being around cars, understanding how they work and being able to get under the hood, repairing them and/or modifying them.`

        history : `Kain grew up in a family that expected a lot out of him. They expected him to do great things from the outset and thus Kain grew up to be a bit of a workaholic, always trying to be as good as he can be. 
        #
        He tried a lot of things, but it was only after he discovered biology that he found his calling. Not possessing enough funds, he joined the great university where he was put in a cheaper, less specialized class that tackles multiple topics at once such as maths, art and what he's here for, biology.
        #
        Ironically, as good and as obsessed with being good as he is, he always sucked at art and never seemed to improve in that department, forcing him to always ask his classmate Eric for assistance.`,
        
        personality: `Kain is a generally focused and hardworking individual. Being so focused on his studies, he tends to miss out on socializing or staying in touch with what's going on in the outside world.
        #
        Being part of Eric's class, he feels like he can relate to Eric's equally lacking sociability, and feels some envy when he sees Eric hanging out with Zack.
        #
        He is generally calm and gentle, but he can get very irritated when he is interrupted during his studies.`

        history : `Juvia was born into the long lasting royal dynasty of Valedryn and soon to become the 15th Valedrian ruler of the kingdom of Genes, succeeding her father Regis Valedryn, the current ruler of Genes, and her late mother Vylra Valedryn, whom passed away when she was only 14.
        #
        Being part of the royal family and destined to be the ruler of her land, she was subject to heavy training. She couldn't make friends with other children outside the royal palace and didn't have the time. Most of her days were taken by ruthless training to become the perfect and ideal queen. Mannerisms, food tastes, ideals, politics... She was also taught about her 'power'; she was a Gifted, someone that can manipulate the power of crystals to their will, but she was also taught to not use that power under any circumstances. At first she was content doing it. But then her world view started to shift after another kid from the royal palace snuck in some movies and proposed her to watch them.
        #
        Watching these movies in secret with him made her realize that there was more to the world than the palace. They ended up becoming friends, and the kid, a young cat boy named Didi, would help her sneak out and let her discover the world, her own kingdom. Didi was a prodigy in technology and his gadgets could easily help her slip out unnoticed. Her eyes were opened by this experience as she walked amongst all the 'normal' people. Afterwards, she got introduced to the internet and all it's wonders... It also introduced her to rather... 'adult material'. As a young maturing teen, it was only natural that the lewd stuff would intrigue her.
        #
        Ever since then, back at the palace, she started to have more of an attitude towards her training. She'd sometimes outright refuse to do what she was told. She was always forbidden from going outside without official decree and an escort, but they reinforced security around her big bedroom. She started feeling like being inside a fancy 5 stars prison, unable to explore the world as she sees fit ike in the movies she saw and that time Didi snuck her out. Fortunately for her, the new security measures did nothing to prefent Didi from sneaking her out again whenever she felt adventurous as long as it wasn't too noticeable.
        #
        Ever since her mother passed away, it seemed like his father, king of the kingdom, started becoming softer and it was easier for her to sneak out and for longer periodss of time. At 19, during one of her escapades, she got approached by a fine, busty gryphon who recognized her as the princess. They both became friends and she invited Juvia to her strip club business to earn some easy money on the side. She finally had a way of feeling absolutely free. Free of the strict rules of the palace even for a short amount of time. She has taken a liking to pole-dancing and offering backroom 'services' and getting a handsome amount from it that she stores in a bank accout she holds on the side.
        #
        She also took her brief moments of freedom to practice casting spells using her birth gift. Not being very strong physically, she now felt like she could defend herself using a few offensive spells she anaged to invoke. She started to feel truly independant. But she was still tied to the royal family, and when the time comes, she's gonna have to take the throne. But she's confident that with her at the command, she can change her kingdom and the way it is run for the better.`,
        
        personality: `Despite being royalty, Juvia acts more like a teenager than most people her age in the royal palace, which would sometimes get her weird looks. She's generally calm and strong willed, and her being stuck inside a palace all her life has led her to become very daring and mischievous.
        #
        Throughout her childhood and juvenile days, she was subject to mandatory 'training' lessons where she's taught to become the ideal princess and future queen. At first she followed those principles, but then her world view shifted after meeting Didi. Making a real friend and having him show her stuff from the outside world as well as enabling her to explore her own kingdom has made her realize that there's more to the world than a nice view on the palace balcony.
        #
        This caused a change in her where she became more open and daring, defying the strict rules of the royal palace. While she is aware of her duty as future ruler of her nation, she now knows there's more to life than the palace and would occasionally sneak out with Didi's assistance, and discover her world, and herself as well. She fully embraced her looks and sexuality and used it to make cash on the side to fund her escapade by working as a pole dancer.
        #
        Juvia is also kind hearted and gentle. She helps her friends out whenever they're feeling down and would do anythng to protect them. While generally a pacifist, she does use her abilities as a Gifted to conjure a few spells to protect herself, or just for her own amusement.`

        history : `Rokka is a part of a military tribe in colony established on a cold and snowy planet called Ba'askh, which is mostly covered in vegetation. Rokka works a scout and lives in a pack alongside Ruki and others.
        #
        Avalis born into that tribe are destined to become soldiers. Those that cannot become soldiers will instead be relegated to a different role that fulfills the tribe’s goals.
        #
        Rokka grew up to be the “lazy teen” type, with a passion for engineering. He would often just lay on a couch and browse the Nexus,  listen to music or tinker around with spare parts and create his own odd little contraptions, and some of his packmates would get mad at him for it.
        #
        Unfortunately, Rokka wasn’t able to become a soldier due to not meeting the requirements. He was kinda terrible with guns and his strength wasn’t exactly up to par... So it was instead decided to make him a scout, due to his curious and courageous nature, exploring places outside the colony’s perimeter and doing reconnaissance on some missions.
        #
        Rokka grew very close to one of his packmates, Ruki, the drone specialist. Like Rokka, he didn’t pass the trials to become a full soldier, so they made him a drone specialist, whose mission is to care for and pilot drones whenever the situation calls for it. Rokka would often come to lend a hand in helping Ruki maintain his drones, thanks to his engineering knowledge.`,
        
        personality: `Rokka has always been the curious type. He loves discovering new stuff and exploring his environment, eventually leading up to him discovering his hobby which is tinkering with drones and building gadgets from spare parts. That curiosity is what led to him becoming a scout when he wasn’t able to become a soldier, exploring dangerous places and points of interests.
        #
        Despite not having the most strength, he still has a very courageous spirit that pushes him to do risky things.He will still defend his pack to the death if the need arises. There’s nothing worse to an avali than losing a packmate or an entire pack.
        #
        Whenever he doesn’t have anything to do, he would spend his time on a pillow, navigating the Nexus, listening to music, tinkering around, or hanging out with his packmate Ruki and assisting him with drone repair. He would sometimes get reprimanded by other fellow packmates who catch him doing nothing on his couch.
        #
        Rokka is also rather cheerful and the optimist type. He would often try boosting the morale of sad packmates and he rarely gives up unless there’s no other options.`

    {
        history : `Ruki is part of a military tribe from colony established on a cold and snowy planet called Ba'askh, which is mostly covered in vegetation. He works as a drone specialist and lives in a pack alongside Rokka and others.
        #
        Avalis born into that tribe are destiined to become soldiers and bear arms for the colony. Some, for whatever reason, don't make it. These are generally relegated to other tasks to assist the tribe in their mission.
        #
        Ruki was a promising trainee sent on an arduous on-field training mission that all young avalis of the tribe will be subjected to. However, at one point, Ruki got attacked by a wild beast that made its way into the training area, which left him severely injured and had to be brought back and placed into care. The training mission had to be aborted and the vicious beast was taken care of.
        #
        While healing from his wounds, Ruki was still eager to help in any way he can, so leadership decided that he be made a drone pîlot. He was given a 'Drone interface headset' which allows him to give commands to and directly control combat and reconaissance drones by connecting to his neural jack. He exceeded in his role as drone pilot, especially during a raid against avali pirates which he played a big part of. Having fully healed, he decided to remain as a drone pilot, which leadership approved of. In fact, he was promoted to drone specialist for his performance on the field and his masterful use of his drones.
        #
        Being a drone specialist does bring in some other responsabilities though; one of them being drone repair and maintenance. While Ruki does manage on his own, mostly thanks to the information he can gather from the Nexus, he will often ask his packmate, and best friend Rokka for assistance, when he's avaliable. Ruki and Rokka share a tight bond so Rokka will always gladly help him, even teach him.
        #
        While Ruki is perfectly content with his current life, memories of that incident during the training mission still lingers in his mind.`,
        
        personality: `Ruki has always been compassionnate and willing to help. He would often assist his packmates with some mundane tasks and do it gladly. Even when he was hospitalized, he was still willing and pretty much asking to help and become a part of the army, which led him to become a drone specialist.
        #
        He's not beyond asking for help either, often asking for his packmate Rokka's help on repairing/maintaining his drones. Despite being an excelent drone pilot, he's not necessarily the best in the mechanics department.
        #
        Ruki is very close to Rokka, and has been since not too long after getting out of the egg. Their bond is such that Ruki would sometimes tease Rokka, leaving him rather flustered. 
        #
        Ruki loves singing. He would sometimes sit besides a small trail of water surrounded by trees and start singing.
        #
        Despite the unfortunate circumstances he endured, he still managed to find his place in the tribe, and became a valuable assets in some operations. Some avalis would look up to him and follow his example, even Rokka... to a certain point. Though he wishes he had more time to spend tending for members of the tribe, and spend more time with Rokka like they used to a long time ago.
        #
        Some avalis would accuse him of wanting to stay as a drone pilot because he's a coward that's too scared to fight like a true soldier and die on the battlefield like one, but he just ignores those clearly jealous losers. `

        personality: `Self proclaimed great programmer and coffee enthusiast, Skript sure doesn’t lack confidence in his skills! He has knowledge in programming languages such as HTML/CSS, php, Javascript, Python, C++, Java, Scratch and more! (P.S. ‘Having knowledge’ doesn’t necessarily mean that he can actually code something from scratch in all of these languages)

        He loves coding and sharing it with his buddies! Feedback is important after all. Though he says he’s a great programmer that’s very skilled, he often spends hours trying to find why his crappy buggy spaghetti code won’t compile, leading to a screeching toaster angry at a laptop. Don’t even get him started on Assembly code and all that jazz! Makes his poor little brain all tingly and fries it... Outside of coding, he’s quite the cheerful boi, at least if he’s had his dose of good caffeine. From espressos to cappuccinos, he’ll drink ‘em all!
