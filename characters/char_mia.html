                        <p>
                            Mia's backstory isn't the most thrilling. She moved out from her parent's home to integrate the city's university and study engineering there. In order to earn some money she earned a job at Meihal's car garage as assistant, which is how they both managed to meet each other. 
                            <br><br>
                            Ever since she was little, she was fascinated with the way cars work by looking at her dad's car every day and wanted to learn more about them. To that end she applied to university and focus on engineering to make her dream come true and maybe even make her own cars! Her and Meihal's shared passion for cars has led them to become friends quickly.

                            
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <b class="titleFont">Personality:</b> <!--Personality-->
                        <p>
                            Contrary to Meihal, Mia is very laidback and stoic. She doesn't have much in terms of social skills and doesn't show much emotions, but she's always helpful when she's available and likes to get the job done well. She loves making snarky jokes and remarks whenever it's appropriate and she isn't one for long conversations, so she prefers small talks and tries to avoid long debates.
                            <br><br>
                            She has a tendency of oversleeping which can end her up in trouble during class because she's often late, but whenever she tries waking up early, she would always have to nap in the afternoon.
                            <br><br>
                            Despite how lazy she may seem, she's pretty hard working. Wether in university or at her work in the garage, she always tries her best doing what she loves, being around cars, understanding how they work and being able to get under the hood, repairing them and/or modifying them.
