                            Rokka is a part of a colony who lives on a slightly snowy planet full of vegetation. That colony is made up of multiple tribes, one of them being a military tribe, which Rokka is a part of.
                            <br><br> 
                            Avalis born into that tribe are destined to become soldiers. Those that cannot become soldiers will instead be relegated to a different role that fulfills the tribe’s goals.
                            <br><br> 
                            Rokka grew up to be the “lazy teen” type, with a passion for engineering. He would often just lay on a couch and browse the Nexus,  listen to music or tinker around with spare parts and create his own odd little contraptions, and some of his packmates would get mad at him for it.
                            <br><br>
                            Unfortunately, Rokka wasn’t able to become a soldier due to not meeting the requirements. He was kinda terrible with guns and his strength wasn’t exactly up to par... So it was instead decided to make him a scout, due to his curious and courageous nature, exploring places outside the colony’s perimeter and doing reconnaissance on some missions.
                            <br><br> 
                            Rokka grew very close to one of his packmates, Ruki, the drone specialist. Like Rokka, he didn’t pass the trials to become a full soldier, so they made him a drone specialist, whose mission is to care for and pilot drones whenever the situation calls for it. Rokka would often come to lend a hand in helping Ruki maintain his drones, thanks to his engineering knowledge.


                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Rokka has always been the curious type. He loves discovering new stuff and exploring his environment, eventually leading up to him discovering his hobby which is tinkering with drones and building gadgets from spare parts. That curiosity is what led to him becoming a scout when he wasn’t able to become a soldier, exploring dangerous places and points of interests.
                            <br><br>
                            Despite not having the most strength, he still has a very courageous spirit that pushes him to do risky things.He will still defend his pack to the death if the need arises. There’s nothing worse to an avali than losing a packmate or an entire pack.
                            <br><br>
                            Whenever he doesn’t have anything to do, he would spend his time on a pillow, navigating the Nexus, listening to music, tinkering around, or hanging out with his packmate Ruki and assisting him with drone repair. He would sometimes get reprimanded by other fellow packmates who catch him doing nothing on his couch.
                            <br><br>
                            Rokka is also rather cheerful and the optimist type. He would often try boosting the morale of sad packmates and he rarely gives up unless there’s no other options.
