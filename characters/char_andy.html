                        <p>
                            Andromeda, also nicknamed “Andy”, is an artificial organic lifeform with integrated cybernetics and a screen display for a face, also known as a protogen. Part of the secret protogen research program of the megacorp Penance aerospace and biotechnologies, him and multiple other protogens were prototypes created with the purpose of one day being able to explore the stars without the constraints of a short lifespan, as well as serve as servants for the wealthy that could afford them. <br><br>

                            Named after the Andromeda galaxy, Andy was part of the second R&D division of the program, alongside some others like Hazard, small and agile, Centurion, big and strong, and Remedy, a nurse. The researchers there were quite affectionate of their little creations and treated them well, even giving them full bedrooms instead of the mandated sleeping capsules. Andy had developed a liking for music and would often sit on his bed listening to music, to which Centurion would come in to remind him that he can’t stay in bed all day. <br><br>

                            However the research program got cancelled around 15 years later, and ‘disposal’ of all the protogens was ordered. The research team naturally protested the liquidation of their creations and burning of a decade of hard work. So Corporate sent mercenaries to do the job for them, and made sure to warn them about that after they were already on their way. The researchers scrambled to save their creations and themselves. But before they knew it, the mercs arrived and started killing everyone there. There were casualties on both the researchers and protogen sides. Andy was in his bedroom in the meantime, when a merc broke in and was about to shoot him.  he narrowly evaded the shot and unsuccessfully tackled the merc, who was about to get him before Centurion came in and saved him, knocking the merc out. they, Remedy, Hazard, and a researcher started escaping through a back door and onto the real world. Some surviving protos and researchers followed. <br><br>
                            Penance afterward tried to hunt down the surviving protogens but public and government backlash made them reconsider. They now act as if this event never happened, after receiving major sanctions and paying reparations to the scientists.
                            In the end, the protogens were accepted as part of society, and Andy pursued his love of music and became DJ.

                        <p>
                            Andy has an easy-going and jolly personality. He likes laying down and listening to music and is often in a joyous mood. He tends to act a little childish sometimes, which can be annoying to some, but he still gets along well with his peers. 
                            While he regrets that he may never be able to explore the stars after the Penance incident, he takes satisfaction in making others happy through sharing his love of music working as a DJ.
