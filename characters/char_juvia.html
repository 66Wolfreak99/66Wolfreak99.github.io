                        <p>
                            Juvia was born into the long lasting royal dynasty of Valedryn and soon to become the 15th Valedrian ruler of the kingdom of Genes, succeeding her father Regis Valedryn, the current ruler of Genes, and her late mother Vylra Valedryn, whom passed away when she was only 14. <br><br>
                            
                            Being part of the royal family and destined to be the ruler of her land, she was subject to heavy training. She couldn't make friends with other children outside the royal palace and didn't have the time. Most of her days were taken by ruthless training to become the perfect and ideal queen. Mannerisms, food tastes, ideals, politics... She was also taught about her 'power'; she was a Gifted, someone that can manipulate the power of crystals to their will, but she was also taught to not use that power under any circumstances. At first she was content doing it. But then her world view started to shift after another kid from the royal palace snuck in some movies and proposed her to watch them.
                            <br><br>
                            Watching these movies in secret with him made her realize that there was more to the world than the palace. They ended up becoming friends, and the kid, a young cat boy named Didi, would help her sneak out and let her discover the world, her own kingdom. Didi was a prodigy in technology and his gadgets could easily help her slip out unnoticed. Her eyes were opened by this experience as she walked amongst all the 'normal' people. Afterwards, she got introduced to the internet and all it's wonders... It also introduced her to rather... 'adult material'. As a young maturing teen, it was only natural that the lewd stuff would intrigue her.
                            <br><br>
                            Ever since then, back at the palace, she started to have more of an attitude towards her training. She'd sometimes outright refuse to do what she was told. She was always forbidden from going outside without official decree and an escort, but they reinforced security around her big bedroom. She started feeling like being inside a fancy 5 stars prison, unable to explore the world as she sees fit ike in the movies she saw and that time Didi snuck her out. Fortunately for her, the new security measures did nothing to prefent Didi from sneaking her out again whenever she felt adventurous as long as it wasn't too noticeable.
                            <br><br>
                            Ever since her mother passed away, it seemed like his father, king of the kingdom, started becoming softer and it was easier for her to sneak out and for longer periodss of time. At 19, during one of her escapades, she got approached by a fine, busty gryphon who recognized her as the princess. They both became friends and she invited Juvia to her strip club business to earn some easy money on the side. She finally had a way of feeling absolutely free. Free of the strict rules of the palace even for a short amount of time. She has taken a liking to pole-dancing and offering backroom 'services' and getting a handsome amount from it that she stores in a bank accout she holds on the side.
                            <br><br>
                            She also took her brief moments of freedom to practice casting spells using her birth gift. Not being very strong physically, she now felt like she could defend herself using a few offensive spells she anaged to invoke. She started to feel truly independant. But she was still tied to the royal family, and when the time comes, she's gonna have to take the throne. But she's confident that with her at the command, she can change her kingdom and the way it is run for the better.

                        <p>
                            Despite being royalty, Juvia acts more like a teenager than most people her age in the royal palace, which would sometimes get her weird looks. She's generally calm and strong willed, and her being stuck inside a palace all her life has led her to become very daring and mischievous.
                            <br><br>
                            Throughout her childhood and juvenile days, she was subject to mandatory 'training' lessons where she's taught to become the ideal princess and future queen. At first she followed those principles, but then her world view shifted after meeting Didi. Making a real friend and having him show her stuff from the outside world as well as enabling her to explore her own kingdom has made her realize that there's more to the world than a nice view on the palace balcony.
                            <br><br>
                            This caused a change in her where she became more open and daring, defying the strict rules of the royal palace. While she is aware of her duty as future ruler of her nation, she now knows there's more to life than the palace and would occasionally sneak out with Didi's assistance, and discover her world, and herself as well. She fully embraced her looks and sexuality and used it to make cash on the side to fund her escapade by working as a pole dancer.
                            <br><br>
                            Juvia is also kind hearted and gentle. She helps her friends out whenever they're feeling down and would do anythng to protect them. While generally a pacifist, she does use her abilities as a Gifted to conjure a few spells to protect herself, or just for her own amusement.
