                        <p>
                            Same as Eric and Zack, Meihal grew up in the orphanage. Meihal is a furred dragon, the offspring of a female dragon and a male canine. Dragons are very proud and elitist creatures, and see furred dragons as “impure” and “unholy”, looking down upon them and shunning them from their society. Meihal, being the unfortunate offspring of a female dragon and a male canine, couldn’t have had a good life due to her very nature and her kind’s views on her type, so she was dropped off at the orphanage when she was still in her egg. 
                            <br><br>
                            She grew up into a big and feisty girl, having developed a keen interest in mechanics from messing around with the headmaster’s car, and crafting various gadgets out of spare parts. She also got a crush on Eric after they had to help each other to clean up the orphanage library as a punishment, but she got adopted before that could go anywhere. She doesn’t seem to mind that her biological parents gave her up as an egg, considering herself lucky that she instead grew up at all with people that care about her and doesn’t shun her for what she is.
                            <br><br>
                            Now she lives on the outskirts of the city of Genes, where she works as a mechanic in her own workshop, fixing and tuning cars, and being a professional racer in track and rally racing.

                        <p>
                            Meihal is a very energetic tomboy with a big heart. She can also be quite the playful type, which can lead to some mischief like the time she made a mess of the library and had to clean it up along with Eric. Her optimistic nature allowed her to grow up happy and chirpy, even despite her circumstances of birth. 
                            <br><br>
                            She has a strong sense of curiosity, which led her to develop her passion for cars and mechanics in general. She likes to craft various gadgets in her spare time, and got herself a job as mechanic, which she still has to this day.
                            <br><br>
                            Her liking for tinkering cars naturally made her fall in love with driving them, which led to her becoming a professional driver participating in track and rally racing championships.
                            <br><br>
                            As a teen, she had a crush on Eric, but it wasn’t able to go anywhere because she was adopted not too long after. However even after all these years, her crush for him still lingers in her heart.
