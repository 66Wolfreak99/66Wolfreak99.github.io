                        <p>
                            Ruki is part of a military tribe from colony established on a cold and snowy planet called Ba'askh, which is mostly covered in vegetation. He works as a drone specialist and lives in a pack alongside Rokka and others.
                            <br><br> 
                            Avalis born into that tribe are destiined to become soldiers and bear arms for the colony. Some, for whatever reason, don't make it. These are generally relegated to other tasks to assist the tribe in their mission.
                            <br><br> 
                            Ruki was a promising trainee sent on an arduous on-field training mission that all young avalis of the tribe will be subjected to. However, at one point, Ruki got attacked by a wild beast that made its way into the training area, which left him severely injured and had to be brought back and placed into care. The training mission had to be aborted and the vicious beast was taken care of.
                            <br><br>
                            While healing from his wounds, Ruki was still eager to help in any way he can, so leadership decided that he be made a drone p√Ælot. He was given a 'Drone interface headset' which allows him to give commands to and directly control combat and reconaissance drones by connecting to his neural jack. He exceeded in his role as drone pilot, especially during a raid against avali pirates which he played a big part of. Having fully healed, he decided to remain as a drone pilot, which leadership approved of. In fact, he was promoted to drone specialist for his performance on the field and his masterful use of his drones.
                            <br><br> 
                            Being a drone specialist does bring in some other responsabilities though; one of them being drone repair and maintenance. While Ruki does manage on his own, mostly thanks to the information he can gather from the Nexus, he will often ask his packmate, and best friend Rokka for assistance, when he's avaliable. Ruki and Rokka share a tight bond so Rokka will always gladly help him, even teach him.
                            <br><br>
                            While Ruki is perfectly content with his current life, memories of that incident during the training mission still lingers in his mind.

                        <p>
                            Ruki has always been compassionnate and willing to help. He would often assist his packmates with some mundane tasks and do it gladly. Even when he was hospitalized, he was still willing and pretty much asking to help and become a part of the army, which led him to become a drone specialist.
                            <br><br>
                            He's not beyond asking for help either, often asking for his packmate Rokka's help on repairing/maintaining his drones. Despite being an excelent drone pilot, he's not necessarily the best in the mechanics department.
                            <br><br>
                            Ruki is very close to Rokka, and has been since not too long after getting out of the egg. Their bond is such that Ruki would sometimes tease Rokka, leaving him rather flustered. 
                            <br><br>
                            Ruki loves singing. He would sometimes sit besides a small trail of water surrounded by trees and start singing.
                            <br><br>
                            Despite the unfortunate circumstances he endured, he still managed to find his place in the tribe, and became a valuable assets in some operations. Some avalis would look up to him and follow his example, even Rokka... to a certain point. Though he wishes he had more time to spend tending for members of the tribe, and spend more time with Rokka like they used to a long time ago.
                            <br><br>
                            Some avalis would accuse him of wanting to stay as a drone pilot because he's a coward that's too scared to fight like a true soldier and die on the battlefield like one, but he just ignores those clearly jealous losers.
