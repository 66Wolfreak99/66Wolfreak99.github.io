                        <p>
                            Eric Stryke is one of the last few remaining members of the much maligned Bloodhound tribe, a once unstoppable group of killer wolves who's sole purpose of existance is to kill anything that aren't part of their tribe due to a parasite embedded within each indidvidual that controls their thoughts and grows as they kill. 
                            <br><br>
                            Eric was found when he was still very young after his mother died trying to raid a farm in the Kamosh countryside. He was brought to an orphanage not too far away where he met Zack. Being very shy and closed, he didn't make many friends. But Zack came in and helped him open up a bit. 
                            <br><br>
                            After they were forced to move to live in the city after the orphanage got burned down by his cousin Szahag, Eric found his love of drawing and focused on that. Bloodhounds were thought extinct ever since the Great Payback more than 200 years ago following the invention of guns, so Eric is still able to live in society without people growing suspicious, especially since his Bloodhound parasite hasn't grown because he hasn't killed anyone, so it remains hidden.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <b class="titleFont">Personality:</b> <!--Personality-->
                        <p>
                            Despite being a Bloodhound, Eric's parasite is too small and underdevelopped to have any significant effects on his psyche. He is an introvert, meaning he's very shy and not very social. Most of the time, he is calm and quiet, prefering not to be the center of attention. He doesn't have many friends due to his shyness. But every friend he makes is valuable to him and he will often share his hobbies and passions with them, and try to stay close to them. 
                            <br><br>
                            While generally non-confrontational (and a bit of a coward), he will however defend the ones he loves and cherishes and do so violently. His parasite still having a subconscious effect on him, it makes him prone to becoming excessively violent in situations like these. However nothing makes him happier than being around small fluffy animals, to the point that it makes his tail wag a lot.
                        </p>
