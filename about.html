                       <p>My name's Wolfreak! I'm just some dude from France who loves to draw furries and play video games. I'm currently working as a full-stack junior web dev, working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP as well as frameworks such as Angular and Node.js. Maybe one day i'll learn other languages and be able to program my own games!</p>

                       <p>I've been a furry since around 2010. I've also been drawing furries at around that time, though they were all just sketches I did while bored in class. However i didn't start engaging with the community until late 2019 when I started drawing for real using my newly acquired Surface pro 7 tablet, which I've used daily ever since. </p>

                       <p>But then why does my personal website look and feel like it came straight from the early 2000's? Well it's because I just like how it looks and feels, lol! </p>
